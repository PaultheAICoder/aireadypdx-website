## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 0
- No deferred work identified in issue #32
- Parent issue #6 tracks overall service pages progress

## Known Limitations & Future Work
- Employee Training and Confidential AI service pages remain as placeholders (tracked in parent issue #6)
- No WorkflowAutomation-specific CSS was needed (design decision to reuse AIConsulting.css)

## Lessons Learned & Workflow Insights (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent delivered a clean implementation that passed all validation on first try
2. CSS reuse strategy (AIConsulting.css) worked perfectly for service page consistency
3. Plan was comprehensive with exact content specifications

### What Could Be Improved
1. Visual verification could use automated screenshots for comparison

### Aggregated Agent Insights

#### From Scout-and-Plan Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- CSS strategy decision (resolved by noting AIConsulting.css uses generic class names)
- Icon availability verification (all needed icons confirmed in Icons.jsx)

**Input Quality Assessment**: 4/5 (missing draft copy for hero section)

**Suggestions for Future**:
- Include draft copy for hero section and service cards in issues
- Specify if new images are needed for pages

#### From Build Agent
**Issues Encountered**: None - plan was well-structured

**Plan Quality Assessment**: 5/5 on all metrics (clarity, completeness, accuracy)

**Code/Architecture Observations**:
- AIConsulting.css uses generic class names that work across all service pages
- All needed icons available in Icons.jsx
- `navigate('/#contact')` pattern works well for cross-route navigation

**Suggestions for Future**:
- Future service pages can follow exact same structure
- Consider creating ServicePage template component if more pages planned

#### From Test-and-Cleanup Agent (this run)
**Validation Issues Found**: None
**Process Observations**: Clean implementation required no fixes

### Recommended Process Changes
1. **Service Page Template** - Consider creating a template component for future service pages (Scout-and-Plan + Build agents)
2. **CSS Sharing Documentation** - Parent Issue #6 should document that all service pages share AIConsulting.css (Build agent)
