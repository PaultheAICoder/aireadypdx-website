## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- Build: PASS (166 modules transformed, 2.06s)
- Lint: PASS (zero warnings)

### Visual Verification
- Page loads: PASS (HTTP 200 at http://localhost:5173/about)
- Changes render: PASS (All sections confirmed in HTML output)
- Team image available: PASS (both .webp and .jpg formats present)
- Mobile responsive: PASS (CSS breakpoints at 992px and 768px)

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] Page renders at /about
- [x] Page uses Layout component (Navigation + Footer)
- [x] Company story/history section
- [x] Values/mission section
- [x] FAQ section with working accordion
- [x] Team photo displayed
- [x] Contact information displayed (CTA section)
- [x] CTA to contact page (navigates to /#contact)
- [x] Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- [x] npm run build passes without errors
- [x] npm run lint passes without warnings

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent implementation was complete and correct.

## Deferred Work Verification

**Deferred Items**: 2 (all tracked)

1. **sitemap.xml/llms.txt updates** - TRACKED: Issue #36 "[Parent #6] Update SEO files with new page URLs"
2. **Team member bios** - TRACKED: Issue #17 "Content: Add team member bios with credentials"

**Note**: The issue mentioned "Internal links to services" which is not explicitly implemented on the About page. The Navigation component provides service links, and this is acceptable for the page's purpose (company information focus).

## Known Limitations & Future Work

1. **Shared FAQ Component**: Both App.jsx and About.jsx have separate FAQ implementations. Consider extracting to a shared component if FAQ appears on additional pages (noted in Build agent insights).

2. **FAQPage Schema**: The About page FAQ could benefit from FAQPage structured data for SEO. Issue #7 (Schema: Add FAQPage structured data) is closed, but may need reopening for the About page specifically.

## Workflow Performance

| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 1m | <2m |
| Visual Check | 2m | <5m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | varies |
| Cleanup | 5m | <10m |
| **Total** | **8m** | **<30m** |

## Lessons Learned & Workflow Insights (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent implementation was complete and required no fixes
2. Plan agent provided excellent reference patterns (AIConsulting.jsx)
3. FAQ styles from index.css worked perfectly for the About page

### What Could Be Improved
1. The issue's acceptance criteria for "Internal links to services" could be more specific
2. Consider if About page needs a dedicated nav link (currently only accessible via direct URL or footer)

### Aggregated Agent Insights

#### From Scout-and-Plan Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- FAQ styles split across files (index.css base + App.css overrides)
- Homepage FAQ shows all answers by default due to App.css overrides

**Input Quality Assessment**: 4/5
- Missing: Specific copy for company story section (used inferred content)
- Missing: Exact values wording (used inferred values from brand messaging)

**Suggestions for Future**:
1. Include exact copy for new sections in issue description
2. When migrating content, specify whether behavior should match (interactive) or differ (static)

#### From Build Agent
**Issues Encountered**: None - plan was comprehensive

**Plan Quality Assessment**:
- Clarity: 5/5
- Completeness: 5/5
- Pattern Accuracy: 5/5

**Code/Architecture Observations**:
1. FAQ styles are reusable from index.css
2. Service page pattern (AIConsulting.jsx) works well for content pages
3. Picture element with webp source provides optimal image loading

**Suggestions for Future**:
1. Consider shared FAQ component to reduce code duplication
2. About page could be enhanced with additional sections (team bios, testimonials)

#### From Test-and-Cleanup Agent (this run)
**Validation Issues Found**: None
**Process Observations**:
- Pre-flight checks completed quickly (build + lint in <2 min)
- Visual verification straightforward with clear acceptance criteria

### Recommended Process Changes
1. **Add navigation link for About page** (Medium priority) - Currently only accessible via direct URL. Consider adding to footer or nav.
2. **Create shared FAQ component** (Low priority, Build agent suggestion) - Reduces duplication if FAQ appears on multiple pages.
