3. Clear acceptance criteria made validation straightforward

### What Could Be Improved
1. XML validation could be automated (though npm build covers this implicitly)

### Aggregated Agent Insights

#### From Scout-and-Plan Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- GitHub issue fetch initially failed - used provided details instead
- Content extraction from JSX pages required reading multiple files

**Input Quality Assessment**: 5/5 - Issue provided complete URL list and priority guidelines

**Suggestions for Future**:
- For SEO file updates, read all target files in parallel to understand existing format

#### From Build Agent
**Issues Encountered**: None - straightforward content update with clear instructions

**Plan Quality Assessment**:
- Clarity of Instructions: 5/5

- robots.txt properly configured for both standard crawlers and AI/LLM bots

**Suggestions for Future**:
- SEO update plans could include a checklist of all URLs to verify cross-file consistency

### Recommended Process Changes
