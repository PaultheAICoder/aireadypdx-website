# Task #11 - AEO: Restructure content with Q&A format - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated**: 2025-12-31T23:55:00Z
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Successfully restructured website content for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) by transforming 11 headings to question-based format and adding 4 TL;DR summaries. All content changes implemented in App.jsx with zero build errors and zero lint warnings.

## What Was Accomplished
**Files Modified**: 1
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` (+23 lines, -19 lines)

**Content Changes**:
- 11 headings transformed from statements to questions
- 4 TL;DR summaries added to major sections (Services, Pricing, Approach, Contact)
- Front-loaded key information in answer paragraphs

**Sections Updated**:
| Section | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| Why Us | 4 H3 headings to Q&A format |
| Services | 1 H2 heading + TL;DR added |
| Pricing | 1 H2 heading + TL;DR added |
| Approach | 1 H2 + 3 H3 headings + TL;DR added |
| Contact | 1 H2 heading + TL;DR added |

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- Build: PASS (vite build completed in 2.06s, 0 errors)
- Lint: PASS (eslint completed with 0 warnings)

### Visual Verification
- Page loads: PASS
- Changed sections render: PASS
- TL;DR summaries display correctly: PASS
- Mobile responsive: N/A (content-only changes)

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent completed all work successfully with no issues requiring remediation.

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items Identified**: 1 (from agent insights)
- Schema.org FAQ markup for new Q&A headings

**Status**: TRACKED
- Issue #7 (FAQPage schema) already CLOSED - FAQ structured data already implemented
- New Q&A content headings do not require separate schema (not in FAQ section)

## Known Limitations & Future Work
- New Q&A headings in main content sections could potentially benefit from additional schema.org markup in future, but this is optional enhancement
- No blockers or incomplete items

## Workflow Performance
| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 1m | <2m |
| Visual Check | 2m | <5m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | varies |
| Cleanup | 5m | <10m |
| **Total** | **8m** | **<30m** |

## Lessons Learned & Workflow Insights (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent executed all 10 subtasks with 100% completion and zero blockers
2. Plan's before/after content blocks made validation straightforward
3. Content changes followed consistent patterns making review efficient

### What Could Be Improved
1. Could add automated content verification (grep for expected patterns) in future workflows

### Aggregated Agent Insights

#### From Scout-and-Plan Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- Line number drift potential (source file ~872 lines, multiple edits in sequence)
- Escaped apostrophes pattern (`&apos;`) needed to be maintained

**Input Quality Assessment**: 4/5
- Missing: specific guidance on structured data (schema.org FAQ markup)
- Missing: preference on TL;DR placement

**Suggestions for Future**:
- Include examples of preferred TL;DR formatting in issues
- Specify if FAQ schema markup should be added for SEO
- Create before/after mapping tables for content restructuring

#### From Build Agent
**Issues Encountered**: None - all subtasks executed smoothly

**Plan Quality Assessment**:
- Clarity: 5/5
- Completeness: 5/5
- Accuracy: 4/5 (line numbers had minor drift but context was clear)

**Code/Architecture Observations**:
- Codebase uses `&apos;` for apostrophes in JSX text content
- All sections follow consistent `section-header` pattern with H2 + supporting paragraphs
- Brand voice "calm, competent, grounded" maintained in new content

**Suggestions for Future**:
- Run build/lint after each phase (rather than each subtask) for efficiency on content changes
- Use existing FAQ section as reference for Q&A tone

#### From Test-and-Cleanup Agent (this run)
**Validation Issues Found**: None - clean validation
**Process Observations**:
- CONTENT task classification was accurate - STANDARD validation sufficient
- Build report's "Test Strategy Recommendation" was helpful for validation planning

### Recommended Process Changes
1. **AEO template creation** - Both Scout-and-Plan and Build agents suggested AEO content restructuring is a repeatable pattern that could become a reusable template (high priority)
2. **Schema.org tracking** - Consider adding schema.org consideration to AEO issues by default (medium priority)

## Git Information
**Commit**: feat(issue #11): Restructure content with Q&A format for AEO
