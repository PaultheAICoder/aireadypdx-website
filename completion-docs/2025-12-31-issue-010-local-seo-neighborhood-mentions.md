**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)
**Date**: 2025-12-31

## Executive Summary
Successfully added Portland metro neighborhood mentions to improve local SEO. Updated Hero section, FAQ section, and LocalBusiness schema. All 4 planned content changes implemented across 2 files.

## What Was Accomplished
**Files Modified**: 2

1. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` - 2 content changes
   - Hero subheading: "Portland-area businesses" -> "businesses across the Portland metro area"
   - FAQ answer: Added Beaverton, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro, Pearl District, Downtown Portland mentions

2. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html` - 2 schema changes
   - areaServed expanded from 2 to 11 entries (10 cities + Pacific Northwest)
   - FAQ schema answer updated to match visible FAQ content

**Neighborhoods Added**:
- Primary (visible content): Beaverton, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro, Pearl District, Downtown Portland
- Secondary (schema only): Gresham, Tualatin, West Linn, Oregon City, Clackamas

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- Build: PASS (2.06s, zero errors)
- Lint: PASS (zero warnings)

### Visual Verification
- Page loads: PASS
- Hero section updated: PASS
- FAQ section updated: PASS
- Schema JSON-LD valid: PASS (build succeeded)

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent's implementation was complete and correct.

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 1

**Observation**: The Build agent noted that there are 2 additional Service schema blocks in index.html (lines 290 and 320) with their own areaServed arrays that were not updated. These still only list Portland.

**Assessment**: This is a minor inconsistency but not part of the original issue scope. The issue specifically mentioned "Update LocalBusiness schema areaServed" which was completed. The Service schemas are a separate concern.

**Recommendation**: Consider future issue to synchronize all areaServed arrays across schema blocks for consistency. Not creating new issue as this is minor and existing SEO issues cover related work.

## Known Limitations & Future Work
1. Service schema areaServed arrays not updated (2 blocks at lines 290 and 320)
2. Consider updating other geo-related meta tags in future SEO work

## Workflow Performance
| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 1m | <2m |
| Visual Check | 1m | <5m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | varies |
| Cleanup | 5m | <10m |
| **Total** | **7m** | **<30m** |

## Lessons Learned & Workflow Insights (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent's implementation was complete and correct - no fixes needed
2. Content changes were natural and readable, avoiding keyword stuffing
3. Schema structure followed existing patterns exactly
4. Plan provided exact line numbers and old/new text which made validation easy

### What Could Be Improved
