## Lessons Learned & Workflow Insights (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent delivered 100% complete implementation with no issues
2. Service page pattern is now well-established - 4th page created seamlessly
3. Plan quality was excellent - full JSX code provided reduced ambiguity

### What Could Be Improved
1. Test-and-Cleanup could be faster for clean builds - minimal validation needed

### Aggregated Agent Insights

#### From Scout-and-Plan Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- No dedicated Server/Database icons in Icons component - worked around with Lock, Shield, Building icons
- Step-number styling used for industries section with icons instead of numbers

**Input Quality Assessment**: 5/5 - GitHub issue was exceptionally well-written with clear structure, content sources, and acceptance criteria.

**Suggestions for Future**:
- When creating service pages, always check Icons.jsx first to identify available icons
- Include line number references from pattern files in the plan
- The issue template used here should be the standard for future service page issues

#### From Build Agent
**Issues Encountered**:
- Dev server port conflict (5173 in use, Vite auto-used 5174) - not a blocker

**Plan Quality Assessment**:
- Clarity: 5/5 - Full JSX code snippets provided for each section
- Completeness: 5/5 - All three phases covered
- Accuracy: 5/5 - AIConsulting.jsx pattern correctly identified

**Code/Architecture Observations**:
- All 4 service pages now follow identical structure
- CSS reuse working well - AIConsulting.css handles all pages
- Icons component has all required icons available
- Image assets were pre-created (40KB webp)

**Suggestions for Future**:
- Service page pattern fully established - future pages can be templated
- Consider generator script if more than 2 additional service pages planned

#### From Test-and-Cleanup Agent (this run)
**Validation Issues Found**: None
**Process Observations**: Clean build with no fixes needed - workflow executed efficiently

### Recommended Process Changes
1. **High-priority**: Use Issue #34 as template for future service page issues - well-structured acceptance criteria made validation straightforward (Scout-and-Plan)
2. **Medium-priority**: Consider creating service page generator script for future similar pages (Build)
