**Generated**: 2025-12-31 23:25 PST
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #10
**Estimated Build Time**: 1-2 hours
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Content
**Source**: GitHub Issue #10
**Priority**: High (labeled high-priority)

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: QUICK - Build + lint only for content/text changes

### Current State Assessment
- **Sections affected**: Hero, FAQ (Who we help), potentially Services header
- **CSS files involved**: None (content only)
- **Files to modify**:
  - `src/App.jsx` - Add neighborhood mentions to visible content
  - `index.html` - Update LocalBusiness schema areaServed array
- **Current behavior**:
  - "Portland" mentioned 7 times in App.jsx
  - "Beaverton" mentioned only in address (3 occurrences)
  - "Pacific Northwest" mentioned once
  - No neighborhood names (Pearl District, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro, etc.)
  - LocalBusiness schema has only Portland and Pacific Northwest in areaServed

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low - Content changes only, no structural or styling changes

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Follow existing natural writing style in FAQ section
**Reference**: Lines 693-699 in App.jsx show existing geographic mentions pattern

## Executive Summary

Add Portland metro neighborhood mentions to improve local SEO without keyword stuffing. This involves:
1. Adding metro area phrase to Hero section
2. Enhancing FAQ "What kinds of businesses" answer with specific neighborhoods
3. Expanding LocalBusiness schema areaServed to include all primary and secondary areas

## Phase 1: Update Hero Section

### Subtask 1.1: Add Metro Area Mention to Hero Subheading
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`
**Pattern**: Enhance existing Portland-area mention with metro scope
**Lines**: 310-312

**Current Text** (line 311):
```jsx
AI has moved from bleeding edge to business essential. AI Ready PDX, powered by <a href="https://vital-enterprises.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vital Enterprises</a>' 30+ years of technology leadership, helps Portland-area businesses adopt AI confidently, practically, and securely.
```

AI Ready PDX, powered by <a href="https://vital-enterprises.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vital Enterprises</a>' 30+ years of technology leadership, helps businesses across the Portland metro area adopt AI confidently, practically, and securely.
```

**Rationale**: Subtle change from "Portland-area" to "Portland metro area" reinforces geographic scope without being heavy-handed.

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build && npm run lint
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Hero text reads naturally

## Phase 2: Update FAQ Section

### Subtask 2.1: Enhance "What kinds of businesses" FAQ Answer
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`
**Pattern**: Natural integration of neighborhood names with existing client examples
**Lines**: 696-700

**Current Text** (lines 698-699):
```jsx
<p>We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits in the Portland metro and Pacific Northwest. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters, professional practices like dental and legal offices, small manufacturers, and community organizations.</p>
```

**New Text**:
```jsx
<p>We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits across the Portland metro area, including Beaverton, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro, and surrounding communities. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters in the Pearl District, professional practices like dental and legal offices in Downtown Portland, and small manufacturers throughout the region.</p>
```

**Rationale**:
- Naturally weaves in 5 primary/secondary areas: Beaverton, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro
- Adds Pearl District and Downtown Portland contextually
- Maintains client examples while adding geographic specificity
- "surrounding communities" covers secondary areas without listing all

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build && npm run lint
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] FAQ answer reads naturally, not keyword-stuffed
- [ ] Maintains existing client type examples

## Phase 3: Update LocalBusiness Schema

### Subtask 3.1: Expand areaServed in Schema.org JSON-LD
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html`
**Pattern**: Follow existing City schema structure
**Lines**: 57-70

**Current areaServed** (lines 57-70):
```json
"areaServed": [
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Portland",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Pacific Northwest"
  }
],
```

**New areaServed**:
```json
"areaServed": [
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Portland",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Beaverton",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Lake Oswego",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Tigard",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Hillsboro",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Gresham",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Tualatin",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "West Linn",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Oregon City",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "Clackamas",
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "State",
      "name": "Oregon"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Pacific Northwest"
  }
],
```

**Rationale**:
- Adds all 9 cities from issue (primary + secondary)
- Pearl District and Downtown Portland are neighborhoods within Portland, not separate cities, so they're correctly covered by Portland entry
- Maintains Pacific Northwest as a broader Place type
- Follows existing schema structure exactly

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] JSON-LD is valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] All 10 cities/places listed in areaServed

## Phase 4: Update FAQ Schema in index.html

### Subtask 4.1: Update FAQ Schema Answer Text
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html`
**Pattern**: Keep schema text consistent with visible FAQ content
**Lines**: 94-99

**Current Text** (line 98):
```json
"text": "We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits in the Portland metro and Pacific Northwest. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters, professional practices like dental and legal offices, small manufacturers, and community organizations."
```

**New Text**:
```json
"text": "We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits across the Portland metro area, including Beaverton, Lake Oswego, Tigard, Hillsboro, and surrounding communities. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters in the Pearl District, professional practices like dental and legal offices in Downtown Portland, and small manufacturers throughout the region."
```

**Rationale**: Schema text must match visible page content for SEO best practices

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Schema FAQ answer matches visible FAQ answer in App.jsx

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **None significant** - Issue was well-structured with clear recommendations and examples

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 5/5
**Missing Information**: None - issue provided specific neighborhoods, implementation examples, and guidelines
**Suggested Input Improvements**: Issue was exemplary - included current state, recommendations with categories, implementation examples, and guidelines

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For SEO-focused content changes, always check index.html for schema.org markup that needs parallel updates
2. Consider creating a checklist of "content change implies schema update" patterns

**For Build Agent**:
1. When updating FAQ content in App.jsx, always search for corresponding FAQPage schema in index.html
2. The areaServed block appears in multiple schema objects (ProfessionalService, Service schemas) - consider if other schemas need updating

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This was a clean content task - similar local SEO tasks could be templated for faster planning
