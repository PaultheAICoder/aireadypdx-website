## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. None - This was a straightforward content update task with no blockers

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Plan provided exact line numbers and complete old/new text
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All 4 subtasks fully specified with validation steps
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Line numbers matched, patterns were correct
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - Plan was comprehensive

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. The project has multiple schema.org blocks in index.html (ProfessionalService, Service schemas) that also have areaServed arrays. The Plan noted this but chose to only update the main LocalBusiness schema. Future runs might consider updating all areaServed blocks for consistency.
2. Schema text should always match visible page content - this is a good pattern to maintain.

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. The plan was exemplary - clear, concise, with exact code snippets and validation commands.
2. Including the "Rationale" for each change helped understand the why behind decisions.

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Content-only changes are low-risk and can be executed quickly.
2. Always verify schema JSON syntax by checking build passes after edits.

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Visual verification of Hero section text change
2. Visual verification of FAQ section when expanded
3. JSON-LD validation could be done via online validators if needed
4. Check that the content reads naturally and doesn't appear as keyword stuffing

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This task was well-suited for the quick workflow - simple content changes with clear specifications.
