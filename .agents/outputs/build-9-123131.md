## Summary
**Phases Completed**: 4 of 4
**Files Modified**:
1. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html` - Enhanced LocalBusiness schema
2. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` - Added map embed, click-to-call, directions link
3. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/index.css` - Added responsive two-column layout styles

## Test Strategy Recommendation
**Category**: FEATURE (Local SEO Enhancement)
**Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + lint + visual verification)

**Testing Focus Areas**:
1. Verify Google Maps iframe loads correctly in browser
2. Test click-to-call on mobile device (should open phone app)
3. Test directions link (should open Google Maps in new tab)
4. Verify responsive layout at various breakpoints (992px, 768px)
5. Validate LocalBusiness schema with Google Rich Results Test

## Performance Metrics
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Plan Review | 2m |
| Phase 1 (Schema) | 3m |
| Phase 2 (JSX) | 4m |
| Phase 3 (CSS) | 3m |

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. **Quote escaping in JSX** - The plan provided straight quotes in JSX strings (Let's, you're, etc.). I proactively converted these to &apos; entities to prevent ESLint warnings. Time: 1 minute extra.
2. **Google Maps embed URL** - The plan noted the embed URL may need adjustment. The constructed URL follows Google's standard embed format and should work, though the Test Agent should verify it loads correctly in a browser. No time lost since URL was accepted.

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Very clear step-by-step instructions with code examples
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All necessary subtasks were included
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 4/5 - Confidential AI flexbox pattern was good reference; line numbers slightly off due to prior changes
**Missing Information in Plan**: None significant - plan included good notes about potential issues

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Contact section now more feature-rich** - The two-column layout with map adds significant local SEO value while improving UX
2. **Consistent design patterns** - The contact-content flexbox follows the same pattern as confidential-ai-content
3. **Analytics integration** - Click-to-call button properly integrates with existing trackPhoneClick analytics function

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. When providing JSX code examples, use HTML entities (&apos;) for quotes to prevent lint warnings

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Test Google Maps iframe in actual browser - curl/command line can only verify structure, not actual map loading
2. Consider adding aria-label to iframe for better accessibility

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Verify the Google Maps iframe actually loads and displays the correct location
2. Test click-to-call on a mobile device
3. Test responsive behavior at 992px and 768px breakpoints
4. Consider validating LocalBusiness schema with Google's Rich Results Test tool
5. Check that geo coordinates (45.4589, -122.8258) are accurate for the address

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This was a well-planned feature with clear scope - good example of effective Scout-and-Plan output
