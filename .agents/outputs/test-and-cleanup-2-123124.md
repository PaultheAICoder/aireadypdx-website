## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished
**Files Modified**: 3

1. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` - CTA text updates, useEffect import, scroll state hook, mobile sticky CTA component
2. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.css` - Form micro-copy styles (.form-microcopy)
3. `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/index.css` - Mobile sticky CTA styles with media query

### CTAs Updated
| Location | Old Text | New Text |
|----------|----------|----------|

| AI Training card | "Get Started" | "See How Much Time You Can Save" |
| Contact form | "Send message" | "Get Your Free AI Audit" |

### New Features Added
- Mobile sticky CTA header (appears after scrolling past hero on mobile viewport <768px)
- Form micro-copy explaining 2 business day response time

### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 1

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - Build agent's implementation was complete and required no fixes.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All subtasks completed as specified
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Clean implementation following existing patterns
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Excellent documentation with line numbers and before/after snippets

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. When dealing with repeated text elements, explicitly list all instances with line numbers to avoid ambiguity
2. Include automated accessibility check recommendations for color-related changes
3. Provide mapping tables for multi-element updates (e.g., which "Get Started" buttons to change)

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Group related changes (imports + hooks) to avoid temporary lint errors during implementation
2. Consider centralizing repeated text content (like CTA text) in constants for easier maintenance

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Add mobile viewport simulation for mobile-specific features
2. Consider automated WCAG contrast checking tools if available

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Accessibility audits should be a standard part of styling/feature changes
2. A/B testing recommendations could be valuable for conversion optimization changes
3. The subtask ordering advice (3.2 before 3.1) from Plan agent was valuable and correctly followed

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at `completion-docs/2025-12-31-issue-002-seo-cta-improvements.md`
2. Test at http://localhost:5173 (dev server running)
3. Manually verify mobile sticky CTA on actual mobile device or browser devtools
4. Consider addressing Issue #29 (button contrast accessibility)
5. Decide on next work item
