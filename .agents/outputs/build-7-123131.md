# Build Agent Report
**Generated**: 2025-12-31T22:50:00Z
**Task**: GitHub Issue #7 - Add FAQPage JSON-LD Schema
**Status**: Complete
**Completion**: 3 of 3 subtasks (100%)

## Execution Log

### Phase 1: Add FAQPage Schema

#### Subtask 1.1: Add FAQPage JSON-LD to index.html
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html`
**Validation Results**:
- Build: PASS (dist/index.html: 6.41 kB, increased from 3.76 kB due to new schema)
- Lint: PASS (no errors or warnings)
- JSON Validation: PASS (valid JSON-LD syntax)

**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] No lint errors
- [x] JSON-LD is valid JSON (no syntax errors)
- [x] Schema appears in dist/index.html after build

**Implementation Notes**:
- Added FAQPage schema after existing ProfessionalService schema (line 70)
- Extracted all 5 FAQ Q&A pairs from App.jsx
- Stripped HTML markup from answers (plain text only)
- Removed promotional content ("just $50 for the first 100 clients*" and "* Limited Time Offer") from schema answers as specified

### Phase 2: Verify Schema Implementation

#### Subtask 2.1: Build and Check Output
**Status**: Completed
**Validation Results**:
```
$ grep -A 5 "FAQPage" /home/pbrown/aireadypdx/dist/index.html
<!-- FAQPage Schema.org JSON-LD -->
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "FAQPage",
      "mainEntity": [
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] FAQPage schema visible in dist/index.html

#### Subtask 2.2: Document Validation Steps
**Status**: Completed

**Post-Deployment Validation Steps** (manual, not automated):

1. **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
   - Paste production URL after deployment
   - Expected result: "FAQ" detected with 5 items

2. **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
   - Test the page URL after deployment
   - Verify FAQPage schema validates without errors

**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Validation instructions documented
- [x] Build agent notes these are post-deployment verification steps

---

## Final Verification
- [x] All phases addressed (2 of 2)
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Lint passes (zero warnings)
- [x] Visual check done (dev server starts successfully)

## Summary
**Phases Completed**: 2 of 2
**Files Modified**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html` (added FAQPage JSON-LD schema, lines 72-120)

**Blockers for Test Agent**: None

## Test Strategy Recommendation
**Category**: FEATURE (SEO Enhancement)
**Strategy**: STANDARD

**Recommended Test Approach**:
1. Verify build passes
2. Verify JSON-LD syntax is valid
3. Verify all 5 FAQ items are present in schema
4. Verify schema content matches App.jsx FAQ content (minus HTML/promotional text)
5. Document post-deployment validation URLs for manual verification

## Performance Metrics
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Plan Review | 2m |
| Pre-Build Verification | 1m |
| Phase 1 (Add Schema) | 3m |
| Phase 2 (Verification) | 2m |
| Documentation | 2m |
| **Total** | **10m** |

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. None - this was a straightforward implementation with clear plan instructions

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Exact JSON-LD content provided, clear location specified
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All steps covered including validation
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Line numbers and existing pattern references were accurate
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - plan was comprehensive

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Good**: Existing schema pattern in index.html made adding second schema trivial
2. **Good**: FAQ content in App.jsx is well-structured with consistent markup patterns
3. **Observation**: FAQ answers in App.jsx contain HTML (links, promotional notes) that need stripping for schema - this was correctly noted in the plan

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For schema additions, continue providing the exact JSON-LD content to insert - this eliminates interpretation errors
2. The plan correctly identified that promotional content should be stripped - good attention to detail

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. JSON syntax validation (via Node.js) was a good addition beyond the standard build/lint checks
2. For schema work, always verify the built output contains the schema (not just source)

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Test that the JSON-LD parses correctly
2. Verify all 5 FAQ items are present with proper @type annotations
3. Verify no HTML tags or promotional content leaked into schema text fields
4. Note: Rich Results Test requires deployed URL - document for post-deployment

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Schema additions are low-risk changes - the STANDARD test strategy is appropriate
2. Consider adding schema validation tooling to CI pipeline for future schema changes
