**Task**: GitHub Issue #22 - Add breadcrumb navigation with JSON-LD schema to service and about pages
**Status**: Complete
**Completion**: 8 of 8 subtasks (100%)

## Execution Log

### Phase 1: Create Breadcrumb Component

#### Subtask 1.1: Create Breadcrumb Component Directory
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**: Created `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/components/Breadcrumb/` directory
**Validation Results**: Directory created successfully
**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Directory created at src/components/Breadcrumb/

#### Subtask 1.2: Implement Breadcrumb Component
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/components/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb.jsx`
**Validation Results**: Lint passed after adding PropTypes validation
**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Component file created with proper imports
- [x] JSON-LD schema injection implemented in useEffect
- [x] Accessibility attributes (aria-label, aria-current) included
- [x] PropTypes validation added to satisfy ESLint
- [x] No lint errors

**Note**: The plan did not include PropTypes validation. Added `PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape(...))` to fix ESLint errors for `react/prop-types` rule. The `prop-types` package was already available as a transitive dependency of `eslint-plugin-react`.

### Phase 4: Visual Verification and Final Testing

#### Subtask 4.1: Visual Verification
**Status**: Completed
**Instructions for Test Agent**:
1. Run `npm run dev` and verify at http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to each page and verify:
   - `/services/ai-consulting` - Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > AI Consulting
   - `/services/workflow-automation` - Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Workflow Automation
   - `/services/employee-training` - Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Employee Training
   - `/services/confidential-ai` - Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Confidential AI
   - `/about` - Breadcrumbs: Home > About
3. Verify styling: Dark green background (rgba(11, 61, 46, 0.95)), white text, teal hover
4. Verify links work: Home goes to /, Services scrolls to /#services
5. Verify current page is non-link text with font-weight: 500
6. Check mobile responsiveness at 768px breakpoint

**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] Code structure verified
- [x] Dev server starts successfully
- [ ] Visual verification pending (requires manual check by Test Agent)

#### Subtask 4.2: Verify JSON-LD Schema
**Status**: Completed
**Instructions for Test Agent**:
1. Open browser DevTools on each service/about page
2. Check `<head>` for script with id="breadcrumb-schema"
3. Verify schema structure:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://aireadypdx.com"},
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Services", "item": "https://aireadypdx.com/#services"},
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "name": "AI Consulting"}
  ]
}
```
4. Navigate between pages and verify schema updates (no duplicates)
5. Navigate away and verify schema is removed (cleanup in useEffect)

**Completion Criteria**:
- [x] useEffect cleanup implemented
- [ ] Runtime verification pending (requires browser check by Test Agent)

---

## Final Verification
- [x] All phases addressed (4 of 4)
- [x] Build passes (zero errors)
- [x] Lint passes (zero warnings)
- [ ] Visual check done (pending Test Agent - dev server running at localhost:5173)

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. **ESLint prop-types validation** - The plan did not include PropTypes. The project uses `react/prop-types` rule which requires prop validation. Fixed by adding PropTypes import and definition. Time spent: 3m.
2. **No issues with component integration** - The pattern was clear and all service pages followed the same structure making bulk updates straightforward.

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Very clear, step-by-step with exact code snippets
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 4/5 - Missing PropTypes requirement (caught by lint)
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Component structure and file paths were accurate
**Missing Information in Plan**:
- Should have included PropTypes validation since ESLint enforces it
- Could have mentioned the relative import path difference for About.jsx vs service pages

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Consistent service page structure** - All 4 service pages share the same pattern (imports, hooks, return structure), making bulk updates easy
2. **Shared CSS file** - Service pages share AIConsulting.css rather than individual CSS, which is efficient but requires awareness when adding styles
3. **Dynamic JSON-LD injection** - Using useEffect for schema injection is clean but requires runtime verification (not testable via build)

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Check ESLint rules for prop validation requirements when planning components that take props
2. Note different relative import paths when components are used at different depths (../components vs ../../components)

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Run lint after each component creation to catch issues early
2. The pattern of creating component, validating, then integrating works well

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Must verify JSON-LD schema in browser DevTools - cannot be verified via build/lint
2. Check schema cleanup on navigation (verify script element is removed when navigating away)
3. Verify breadcrumb links work correctly for hash navigation (/#services)
4. Test mobile responsiveness at 768px - breadcrumb text size reduces to 0.8rem

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. The plan was comprehensive and well-structured
2. Consider adding a "Pre-requisites" section to plans that lists ESLint rules or dependencies that might need attention
