# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2025-12-31T12:31:00Z
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #14
**Estimated Build Time**: 1-2 hours
**Complexity**: Low-Medium

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Accessibility / Content Enhancement
**Source**: GitHub Issue #14
**Priority**: Medium (accessibility improvement + SEO benefit)

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + visual verification)

### Current State Assessment
- **Logo images**: Already have proper alt text
  - Line 266: `logo-nav.png` with `alt="AI Ready PDX"`
  - Line 777: `logo-full.png` with `alt="AI Ready PDX"`
- **Hero background**: CSS background-image (decorative, no alt needed)
  - Line 281 in index.css: `url('/images/hero/hero-background.jpg')`
- **Section images mentioned in issue**: Files exist but are NOT currently used in App.jsx
  - `public/images/sections/about-team.jpg` (exists, not referenced)
  - `public/images/sections/private-ai.png` (exists, not referenced)
  - `public/images/sections/cta-consultation.png` (exists, not referenced)

### Key Finding
The issue assumes images are being used without alt text, but investigation reveals:
1. The logo images ALREADY have proper alt text
2. The section images (about-team, private-ai, cta-consultation) are NOT currently referenced in the code
3. The hero background is a CSS background-image (decorative, doesn't support alt text)

This issue requires a **clarification decision**:
- **Option A**: Add the unused section images to appropriate sections with proper alt text
- **Option B**: Close the issue as invalid since the referenced images aren't actually used
- **Option C**: Only rename the hero-background.jpg file (partial implementation)

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple if Option B/C, Moderate if Option A
**Effort**: 30 min (Option C) to 2 hours (Option A)
**Risk**: Low - No existing functionality would be affected

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Existing `<img>` tag pattern from logo images
**Reference**: Lines 266 and 777 in `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`

**Logo Image Pattern:**
```jsx
<img src="/images/logos/logo-nav.png" alt="AI Ready PDX" className="nav-logo-img" />
```

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation reveals a mismatch between the issue description and actual codebase state. The two logo images already have proper alt text. Three section images (about-team.jpg, private-ai.png, cta-consultation.png) exist as files but are NOT referenced anywhere in the code. The hero background is a CSS background-image that doesn't support alt text.

**Recommended approach**: Implement Option A - add the unused images to their appropriate sections with proper alt text, fulfilling the accessibility intent of the issue.

## Phase 1: File Renaming (SEO Improvement)

### Subtask 1.1: Rename hero-background.jpg for SEO
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/images/hero/hero-background.jpg`
**Pattern**: Descriptive, hyphenated filename with keywords
**Instructions**:
1. Rename the file:
   - FROM: `hero-background.jpg`
   - TO: `portland-ai-consulting-hero.jpg`
2. Update the CSS reference in `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/index.css` at line 281:
   - FROM: `url('/images/hero/hero-background.jpg')`
   - TO: `url('/images/hero/portland-ai-consulting-hero.jpg')`

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] File renamed successfully
- [ ] CSS reference updated
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Hero section displays correctly (background image loads)

## Summary of Deliverables

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/index.css` (hero background URL update)
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` (add 3 section images with alt text)
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.css` (add image styling)

**Files Renamed**:
- `public/images/hero/hero-background.jpg` -> `portland-ai-consulting-hero.jpg`
- `public/images/sections/about-team.jpg` -> `ai-ready-pdx-team-portland.jpg`
- `public/images/sections/private-ai.png` -> `secure-on-premise-ai-server.png`
- `public/images/sections/cta-consultation.png` -> `ai-strategy-consultation-portland.png`

**Alt Text Added**:
| Image | Alt Text |
|-------|----------|
| ai-ready-pdx-team-portland.jpg | "AI Ready PDX consulting team helping Portland businesses with AI adoption" |
| secure-on-premise-ai-server.png | "Secure on-premise AI server for confidential business data" |
| ai-strategy-consultation-portland.png | "AI strategy consultation session with Portland business owner" |

## Handoff to Build Agent

1. **IMPORTANT**: Confirm with stakeholder before Phase 2 - The section images are currently unused and adding them changes the site design
2. Execute subtasks in exact order
3. Test completion criteria before moving to next subtask
4. Follow reference patterns exactly (especially the img tag structure)
5. Run `npm run dev` after each phase for visual verification
6. Note: ESLint config is missing, so `npm run lint` will fail - skip lint validation

---

## Alternative Implementation (Minimal)

If stakeholder decides NOT to add the unused images, implement only:

### Minimal Subtask: Rename hero-background.jpg only
**Instructions**:
1. Rename `/public/images/hero/hero-background.jpg` to `/public/images/hero/portland-ai-consulting-hero.jpg`
2. Update CSS reference in `/src/index.css` line 281
3. Close issue with note explaining that:
   - Logo images already have proper alt text
   - Section images are not currently in use
   - Hero background is CSS (decorative, no alt text needed)

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **Issue-Reality Mismatch**: The GitHub issue assumes images are in use without alt text, but investigation revealed the images exist as files but aren't referenced in the code. This required pivoting to understand the actual intent.
2. **ESLint Configuration Missing**: Running `npm run lint` fails because the project is missing `eslint.config.js`. This doesn't block the work but affects validation capabilities.

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 3/5
**Missing Information**:
- Whether the section images should actually be added to the site or if this was written expecting them to already be there
- Whether file renaming is required or optional
- Priority/urgency of this accessibility work

**Suggested Input Improvements**:
- Include actual grep/search results showing current state of images in code
- Clarify if images not currently in use should be added
- Specify if this blocks any accessibility audit or compliance requirement

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Always verify that elements mentioned in issues actually exist in the code before planning - grep for specific strings early
2. When issues reference files, check both if files exist AND if they're actually used

**For Build Agent**:
1. Pause before Phase 2 and confirm with user that adding new images to sections is desired
2. The ESLint config is missing - don't expect `npm run lint` to work
3. Test visually after each file rename to ensure images still load

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Consider adding a "validation" step in issue templates to confirm the issue author has verified the current state
2. Issues that mention accessibility should include current audit results or specific WCAG criteria being violated
