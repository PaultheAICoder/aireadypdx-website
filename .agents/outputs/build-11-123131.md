## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. **None** - All subtasks executed smoothly with no blockers or unexpected issues

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 4/5 (line numbers had minor drift from original, but context was clear enough)
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - plan was comprehensive

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Escaped apostrophes** - The codebase uses `&apos;` for apostrophes in JSX text content. This pattern was maintained in new content.
2. **Section structure consistency** - All sections follow a consistent `section-header` pattern with H2 + supporting paragraphs, making transformations predictable.
3. **Brand voice maintained** - New content follows the "calm, competent, grounded" voice specified in CLAUDE.md.

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. The plan's before/after content blocks were extremely helpful - continue this pattern
2. Including the full JSX context (not just the text) made editing precise

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Reading the full file once at the start was sufficient for this content-only change
2. Running build/lint after each phase (rather than each subtask) was efficient for content changes

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Verify all new headings display correctly at various screen sizes
2. Check that TL;DR summaries are visually distinct (bold formatting works)
3. Confirm Q&A headings read naturally in context
4. Suggested manual test: Read through each section to verify flow makes sense

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. AEO content restructuring is a repeatable pattern - could become a template
2. Consider adding schema.org FAQ markup in a follow-up issue for enhanced AEO
