## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - Build agent delivered clean, working implementation

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5
**Code Quality**: 5/5
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Continue providing exact content specifications (worked very well here)
2. Include icon availability check in investigation (prevents build failures)

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. This service page pattern is now established - WorkflowAutomation matches AIConsulting exactly
2. CSS reuse via import statement is the correct approach for all service pages

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Service page validation can be streamlined since pattern is consistent
2. Acceptance criteria verification checklist worked well

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Service page creation is now a well-documented pattern taking ~30 minutes total
2. Consider batching remaining service pages (Employee Training, Confidential AI) for efficiency

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-032-workflow-automation-page.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173/services/workflow-automation
3. Continue with remaining service pages from parent issue #6
