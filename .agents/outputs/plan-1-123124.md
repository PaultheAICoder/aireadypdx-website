# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2024-12-31 12:31:24
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #1
**Estimated Build Time**: 0.5 hours
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Content
**Source**: GitHub Issue #1
**Priority**: Critical (labeled as such in issue)

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: QUICK (content/text change - build + lint only)

### Current State Assessment
- **Section affected**: Hero section in `src/App.jsx` (line 287)
- **CSS files involved**: None (no styling changes needed)
- **Current behavior**: H1 reads "2026 is the Year of AI. Let's get you ready." with a `<br />` tag separating the two sentences

### Findings

#### H1 Tag Verification
- **Confirmed**: Only ONE H1 tag exists in the entire page (line 287)
- **Current H1**: `<h1>2026 is the Year of AI.<br />Let's get you ready.</h1>`
- **Location**: Inside Hero section (`id="home"`)

#### SEO Issue Confirmed
The current H1 lacks critical keywords:
- Missing "AI Consulting" - core service keyword
- Missing "Portland" - local SEO keyword
- Missing "Business Automation" - secondary service keyword

These keywords are essential for:
1. Search engine ranking (traditional SEO)
2. AI engine citation (AEO/GEO - Answer Engine Optimization/Generative Engine Optimization)
3. Local SEO visibility for Portland market

#### Brand Voice Check
From `custom-website-build.md`:
- Brand personality: "calm, competent, grounded, local neighbor - not hype-driven"
- Avoid jargon like "disrupt," "paradigm shift," "synergy"
- Original H1 from spec (line 117): "Experienced tech leaders for your AI journey."
- Secondary taglines include: "Practical AI for Portland-area businesses"

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: <0.5 hours
**Risk**: Low - single text change, no structural modifications

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Simple text replacement in JSX
**Reference**: Line 287 in `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`

## Executive Summary

This is a simple content change to replace the current H1 heading with an SEO-optimized version that includes primary keywords ("AI Consulting," "Portland") while maintaining brand voice. The change affects a single line in `src/App.jsx` and requires no CSS modifications.

## Recommended H1 Options Analysis

The issue proposes three options:
1. "AI Consulting & Business Automation for Portland"
2. "Portland's AI Consulting Partner for Small Business"
3. "AI Ready PDX: AI Consulting & Automation in Portland"

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - "Portland's AI Consulting Partner for Small Business"

**Rationale**:
- Includes "Portland" (local SEO)
- Includes "AI Consulting" (primary service keyword)
- Includes "Small Business" (target audience keyword)
- "Partner" aligns with brand voice (helpful neighbor, not aggressive vendor)
- Most natural reading flow
- Avoids jargon and maintains calm, grounded tone

**Alternative if more keyword density needed**: Option 1 - "AI Consulting & Business Automation for Portland" (adds "Business Automation" keyword)

## Phase 1: Update H1 Heading

### Subtask 1.1: Replace H1 Content in Hero Section
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`
**Line**: 287
**Pattern**: Direct text replacement

**Current Code (line 287)**:
```jsx
            <h1>2026 is the Year of AI.<br />Let's get you ready.</h1>
```

**New Code (recommended - Option 2)**:
```jsx
            <h1>Portland&apos;s AI Consulting Partner for Small Business</h1>
```

**Notes**:
- Use `&apos;` for the apostrophe to avoid ESLint `react/no-unescaped-entities` warning
- Remove the `<br />` tag since the new heading is a single phrase
- Keep the same indentation (12 spaces)

**Alternative (Option 1) if stakeholder prefers more keywords**:
```jsx
            <h1>AI Consulting &amp; Business Automation for Portland</h1>
```

**Instructions**:
1. Open `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx`
2. Navigate to line 287 (Hero section)
3. Replace the entire `<h1>...</h1>` line with the new content
4. Ensure proper HTML entity escaping for apostrophe

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes with no errors
- [ ] Lint passes with no warnings
- [ ] H1 contains "Portland" keyword
- [ ] H1 contains "AI Consulting" keyword
- [ ] H1 is grammatically correct and reads naturally
- [ ] Only ONE H1 tag exists on page (verify with grep)

---

## Phase 2: Verification

### Subtask 2.1: Verify Single H1 Tag
**Command**:
```bash
grep -n "<h1" /home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx
```

**Expected Output**: Single line showing the new H1 on line 287

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Only one H1 tag in the file
- [ ] H1 is in the Hero section

## Summary of Deliverables

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` (1 line change)

## Handoff to Build Agent

1. Execute Subtask 1.1: Replace H1 content in `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` line 287

3. Run `grep -n "<h1" /home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` to confirm single H1
4. Visual verification optional but recommended: `npm run dev` and check Hero section
5. Commit with message referencing Issue #1

**Important**: Use `&apos;` for apostrophe in JSX to avoid lint warnings.

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation

**Suggested Input Improvements**: None needed - this issue is an excellent template for future SEO-related issues.

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:

**For Build Agent**:
1. The recommended option (Option 2) balances SEO needs with brand voice. If stakeholder feedback requires different keywords, Option 1 provides an alternative.
2. Remember to use HTML entities (`&apos;`) for special characters in JSX.

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This issue demonstrates good practice of including line numbers in GitHub issues - makes investigation faster.
2. The issue's "critical" label is appropriate given SEO impact on discoverability.

## Decision Point for Build Agent

**Primary Recommendation**: Use Option 2 - "Portland's AI Consulting Partner for Small Business"

If the stakeholder or product owner prefers maximum keyword density, use Option 1 instead:
- Option 1: "AI Consulting & Business Automation for Portland"

Both options satisfy the SEO requirements. Option 2 is recommended for its more natural, brand-aligned tone.
