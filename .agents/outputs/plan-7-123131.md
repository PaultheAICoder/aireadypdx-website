# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2025-12-31T22:45:00Z
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #7
**Estimated Build Time**: 0.5 hours
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Feature (SEO Enhancement)
**Source**: GitHub Issue #7
**Priority**: High (labeled high-priority, seo, aeo, schema)

### Task Classification
**Category**: FEATURE
**Test Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + lint + schema validation tools)

### Current State Assessment
- **Section affected**: FAQ section in `src/App.jsx` (lines 678-722)
- **CSS files involved**: None
- **Current behavior**:
  - FAQ section exists with 5 FAQ items
  - Each FAQ has question (h3) and answer (div.faq-answer with p elements)
  - Existing schema.org JSON-LD already present in `index.html` (lines 34-70) for ProfessionalService
  - No FAQPage schema currently implemented

### Existing FAQ Content (extracted from App.jsx):

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 0 | Who is AI Ready PDX? | AI Ready PDX is part of Vital Enterprises, with 30+ years leading global technology consortiums and 17 years building complex products for leading brands. We help Portland-area businesses and nonprofits adopt AI practically... |
| 1 | What kinds of businesses do you work with? | We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits in the Portland metro and Pacific Northwest. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters, professional practices... |
| 2 | Do you offer on-premise AI solutions? | Yes. For organizations with strict data privacy or compliance requirements, we can deploy local AI appliances on your network. Your data never leaves your building... |
| 3 | What does an AI Readiness Session cover? | In our 60-90 minute session (just $50 for the first 100 clients*), we review how your organization runs today, identify 3-5 specific AI opportunities with rough ROI estimates... |
| 4 | Is AI safe for sensitive data like legal or medical records? | It can be, with the right setup. We offer both on-premise solutions where data never leaves your network, and locked-down cloud environments with private networking... |

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: 0.5 hours
**Risk**: Low (adding static JSON-LD, no runtime code changes)

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Existing schema.org JSON-LD block in `index.html` (lines 34-70)
**Reference**: ProfessionalService schema already uses proper structure with @context, @type

### Implementation Approach Decision

**Recommended**: Option 1 - Static JSON-LD in `index.html`

**Rationale**:
1. FAQ content is static and unlikely to change frequently
2. Simplest implementation with no runtime overhead
3. Follows existing pattern in `index.html` (ProfessionalService schema)
4. Guaranteed to be in page source for crawlers (no hydration wait)
5. No new dependencies required

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Option 2 (Dynamic React generation): Adds unnecessary complexity, potential hydration issues
- Option 3 (react-helmet): Requires new dependency, overkill for static content

---

## Executive Summary

Add FAQPage structured data schema to `index.html` as a second JSON-LD script block following the existing ProfessionalService schema pattern. This enables rich FAQ snippets in Google search results and improves AI citation visibility for the 5 existing FAQ items.

---

## Phase 1: Add FAQPage Schema

### Subtask 1.1: Add FAQPage JSON-LD to index.html

**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html`
**Pattern**: Follow existing JSON-LD block structure (lines 34-70)
**Location**: Insert after line 70 (after closing `</script>` of ProfessionalService schema)

**Instructions**:

1. Add a new `<script type="application/ld+json">` block after the existing schema
2. Include FAQPage schema with all 5 FAQ items
3. Strip HTML markup from answers (plain text only for schema)
4. Remove promotional content like asterisk notes from answers

**JSON-LD Content to Add** (insert after line 70):

```html
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "FAQPage",
      "mainEntity": [
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Who is AI Ready PDX?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "AI Ready PDX is part of Vital Enterprises, with 30+ years leading global technology consortiums and 17 years building complex products for leading brands. We help Portland-area businesses and nonprofits adopt AI practically—projects that ship in weeks, clear explanations of what AI can do, and a pace that respects your culture."
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "What kinds of businesses do you work with?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits in the Portland metro and Pacific Northwest. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters, professional practices like dental and legal offices, small manufacturers, and community organizations."
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Do you offer on-premise AI solutions?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. For organizations with strict data privacy or compliance requirements, we can deploy local AI appliances on your network. Your data never leaves your building, and you get the same capabilities as cloud AI without the privacy concerns."
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "What does an AI Readiness Session cover?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "In our 60-90 minute session, we review how your organization runs today, identify 3-5 specific AI opportunities with rough ROI estimates, recommend whether on-premise, cloud, or simple SaaS tools make sense for you, and provide a written AI Opportunities Snapshot you can share with your team."
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Is AI safe for sensitive data like legal or medical records?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "It can be, with the right setup. We offer both on-premise solutions where data never leaves your network, and locked-down cloud environments with private networking. We also train your team on what's safe to use AI for and what should stay in your core systems."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    </script>
```

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] JSON-LD is valid JSON (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Schema appears in dist/index.html after build

---

## Phase 2: Verify Schema Implementation

### Subtask 2.1: Build and Check Output

**Instructions**:
1. Run production build
2. Check that schema is present in built HTML

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
grep -A 5 "FAQPage" /home/pbrown/aireadypdx/dist/index.html
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] FAQPage schema visible in dist/index.html

### Subtask 2.2: Document Validation Steps

**Instructions**:
Provide validation URLs for manual testing (not automated):

1. **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
   - Paste production URL or use "Code" tab to paste HTML
   - Should show "FAQ" detected with 5 items

2. **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
   - Test the page URL
   - Verify FAQPage schema validates without errors

**Note**: These are manual validation steps to be performed after deployment, not part of the automated build process.

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Validation instructions documented
- [ ] Build agent notes these are post-deployment verification steps

## Summary of Deliverables

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html` - Add FAQPage JSON-LD schema block

**Files Created**: None

**Dependencies Added**: None

---

## Handoff to Build Agent

1. Execute subtasks in exact order
2. Test completion criteria before next subtask
3. Follow existing JSON-LD pattern exactly (indentation, structure)
4. Ensure JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quoting)
5. Run `npm run dev` for visual verification (optional - no visual changes expected)

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- Insert new script block AFTER line 70 (after existing ProfessionalService schema closing tag)
- Keep same indentation style as existing schema (4 spaces)
- Plain text answers only (no HTML in "text" fields)
- Remove promotional asterisk notes from schema answers (keep in visible FAQ)

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **None significant** - Issue was well-documented with clear requirements and implementation options
2. **FAQ content extraction** - Had to manually extract text from JSX with embedded links and formatting; schema requires plain text

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 5/5
**Missing Information**: None - issue included line numbers, implementation options, and validation methods
**Suggested Input Improvements**: None needed - this is an exemplary issue

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For schema-related issues, automatically check for existing schema patterns in index.html first
2. Consider creating a schema template library for common types (FAQPage, LocalBusiness, etc.)

**For Build Agent**:
1. The FAQ answers contain promotional content (asterisk notes like "* Limited Time Offer") that should NOT be included in schema text - this is intentional
2. Validate JSON syntax carefully - trailing commas in JSON are syntax errors
3. This is a static HTML change with no runtime code modifications

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Schema validation tools (Google Rich Results Test, Schema.org Validator) require a deployed URL or manual HTML paste - cannot be automated in CI
2. Consider adding a post-deployment checklist for SEO-related changes
