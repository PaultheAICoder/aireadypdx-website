## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
None - this was a straightforward single-line content change with clear instructions from the Plan agent.

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Very clear with exact line numbers and code snippets
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All necessary steps included
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Line number was accurate, code matched exactly
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - the plan was thorough

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. The monolithic `App.jsx` structure makes single-line changes easy to locate and modify
2. Using HTML entities (`&apos;`) for special characters in JSX is essential to avoid lint warnings
3. The removed `<br />` tag simplifies the H1 structure since the new heading is a single phrase

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For simple content changes, the plan could include a "fast track" indicator to signal minimal verification needed
2. The plan's decision point section (offering Option 1 vs Option 2) was helpful for documenting alternatives

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Always verify the exact line number matches before editing (it matched perfectly in this case)
2. Pre-build verification caught that the project was already in a clean state

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. This is a QUICK test strategy task - only build and lint verification needed
2. Visual verification is optional but recommended to confirm H1 displays correctly in Hero section
3. SEO keywords to verify are present: "Portland", "AI Consulting", "Small Business"

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This issue demonstrates excellent GitHub issue formatting with line numbers and clear requirements
2. The Plan agent's option analysis was thorough but Build followed the primary recommendation as instructed
