**Generated**: 2026-01-01 21:15 PST
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #36
**Estimated Build Time**: 1 hour
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Content
**Source**: GitHub Issue #36 (final sub-issue 7 of 7 for parent Issue #6)
**Priority**: Medium

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: QUICK (Build + lint only - for content/text changes)

### Current State Assessment

**Files to Modify**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/sitemap.xml` - Currently only has homepage entry
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/llms.txt` - Currently links to homepage sections only
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/llms-full.txt` - Contains detailed homepage content only
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/robots.txt` - Already allows `/`, only blocks `/novus-migration-status`

**Existing Format Analysis**:

1. **sitemap.xml** (9 lines):
   - Uses standard sitemap protocol
   - Entry format: `<url><loc>URL</loc><lastmod>DATE</lastmod><changefreq>monthly</changefreq><priority>X.X</priority></url>`
   - Homepage has priority 1.0

2. **llms.txt** (40 lines):
   - Follows llms.txt specification
   - Structure: Title > Description > Services > Pricing > Industries > Contact > Optional
   - Links use fragment anchors to homepage sections (e.g., `/#services`)
   - Need to update service links to new dedicated pages

3. **llms-full.txt** (158 lines):
   - Comprehensive content with all sections
   - Organized with markdown headers
   - Need to add detailed content for each new page

4. **robots.txt** (39 lines):
   - Already configured correctly
   - Allows all paths except `/novus-migration-status`
   - No changes needed - new pages will be allowed by default

**New Pages to Add**:
| URL | Priority | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `/services/ai-consulting` | 0.9 | AI readiness assessments, strategy roadmaps, opportunity identification |
| `/services/workflow-automation` | 0.9 | Chatbots, voice agents, process automation, outreach automation |
| `/services/employee-training` | 0.9 | Executive briefings, team training, agentic coding tools |
| `/services/confidential-ai` | 0.9 | On-premise, private cloud, air-gapped AI solutions |
| `/about` | 0.8 | Company story, values, FAQs |

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: ~1 hour
**Risk**: Low - content-only changes to static files

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Existing sitemap.xml entry structure, llms.txt section format
**Reference**: Lines 3-8 in sitemap.xml, full structure in llms.txt

---

## Executive Summary

Update all SEO files to include the five new pages (four service pages and about page). Add URL entries to sitemap.xml with appropriate priorities, update llms.txt service links to point to dedicated pages, and add comprehensive content sections to llms-full.txt for each new page. No changes needed to robots.txt as new pages are already allowed.

---

## Phase 1: Update sitemap.xml

### Subtask 1.1: Add New URLs to sitemap.xml
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/sitemap.xml`
**Pattern**: Follow existing URL entry structure (lines 3-8)
**Instructions**:

1. Add five new `<url>` entries before the closing `</urlset>` tag
2. Use today's date (2026-01-01) for `<lastmod>`
3. Use `monthly` for `<changefreq>` (consistent with homepage)
4. Set priority 0.9 for service pages, 0.8 for about page

**New content to add after line 8 (before `</urlset>`)**:

```xml
  <url>
    <loc>https://aireadypdx.com/services/ai-consulting</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-01-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>

    <lastmod>2026-01-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://aireadypdx.com/about</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-01-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
```

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build --prefix /home/pbrown/aireadypdx
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] sitemap.xml contains 6 total URL entries (1 homepage + 4 service pages + 1 about page)
- [ ] All URLs use `https://aireadypdx.com` base
- [ ] Priorities are correct (1.0 homepage, 0.9 services, 0.8 about)

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. GitHub issue fetch failed - Used provided details from input instead. Not a blocker.
2. Content extraction from JSX pages required reading multiple files - Resolved by parallel reads.

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 5/5
**Missing Information**: None - Issue provided complete URL list and priority guidelines
**Suggested Input Improvements**: None needed - this was a well-structured issue

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For SEO file updates, always read all target files in parallel to understand existing format
2. Content for llms-full.txt should be extracted from actual page components to ensure accuracy

**For Build Agent**:
1. sitemap.xml must remain valid XML - be careful with formatting
2. llms.txt and llms-full.txt are markdown files - ensure proper formatting
3. No robots.txt changes needed - this is intentional, not an oversight

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. SEO updates should be done after all related pages are complete (as was done here)
2. Consider automating sitemap.xml generation from routes in future
