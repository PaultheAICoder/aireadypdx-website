**New Schemas Added** (5 total):
| Schema Type | Name | Price | Lines |
|-------------|------|-------|-------|
| Course + Offer | AI Readiness Session | $50 | 122-146 |
| Course + Offer | AI Training & Quick Wins | $1,500/quarter | 148-171 |
| Course + Offer | AI Deep Dive | $2,500 | 173-196 |
| Service | Workflow Automation | Custom | 198-226 |
| Service | Confidential AI | Custom | 228-256 |

**Blockers for Test Agent**: None

## Test Strategy Recommendation
**Category**: FEATURE (SEO/Schema Enhancement)
**Strategy**: STANDARD - Build + lint + schema validation

**Recommended Post-Deployment Validation**:
1. Use Google Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate all schemas
2. Use Schema Markup Validator (https://validator.schema.org/) for detailed validation
3. Verify all 7 JSON-LD blocks are detected (2 existing + 5 new)

## Performance Metrics
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Plan Review | 1m |
| Pre-build Verification | 1m |
| Phase 1 (3 Course schemas) | 4m |
| Phase 2 (2 Service schemas) | 3m |
| Phase 3 (Validation) | 1m |
| Report Generation | 2m |
| **Total** | **12m** |

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. **None** - Implementation proceeded smoothly. The plan was well-structured with exact JSON blocks provided.

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Excellent. Each subtask had complete JSON blocks ready to copy.
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All steps were clearly defined with validation commands.
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Existing schema patterns were correctly identified and reused.
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - The plan was comprehensive.

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Schema organization** - Currently using separate `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks for each schema. This is valid but could be consolidated into a single `@graph` structure in the future for cleaner code.
2. **Provider consistency** - All new schemas use the same provider structure, maintaining consistency with existing schemas.
3. **areaServed pattern reuse** - The Service schemas correctly reuse the areaServed pattern from the existing ProfessionalService schema.

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. The approach of providing complete JSON blocks was excellent - continue this pattern for schema tasks.
2. Consider adding a note about priceValidUntil dates that may need updating in the future (AI Readiness Session uses 2025-12-31).

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Schema tasks are straightforward when JSON is pre-validated in the plan.
2. Running build after each subtask effectively catches JSON syntax errors early.

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Primary validation is post-deployment using Google Rich Results Test.
2. Verify all 7 schema blocks are present in the built dist/index.html.
3. Consider testing with Schema.org validator before deployment.

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Schema tasks are well-suited for this workflow - clear input, clear output, validation is straightforward.
2. This issue is a good example of a well-scoped, focused task with clear success criteria.
