## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - Build agent output was complete and correct.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All 7 sections implemented
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Follows established patterns exactly
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Clear execution log with validation results

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Continue providing full JSX code for complex sections - significantly reduces build time
2. Continue checking Icons.jsx availability before planning sections

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Service page pattern now fully established - 4 identical implementations
2. Template or generator script would reduce repetitive work

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. For clean builds, validation can be streamlined - focus on visual check
2. Consider automated screenshot comparison for visual regression

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Issue #34 template quality was excellent - use as reference for future issues
2. Three-phase approach (create, route, verify) works well for new pages
3. Pre-created image assets prevent delays during build phase

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-034-confidential-ai-page.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173/services/confidential-ai
3. Verify links from services table on homepage work
4. Decide on next work item from Issue #6 (parent architecture issue)
