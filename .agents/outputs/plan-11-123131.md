# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2025-12-31T23:35:00Z
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #11
**Estimated Build Time**: 3-4 hours
**Complexity**: Moderate

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Content
**Source**: GitHub Issue #11 - AEO: Restructure content with Q&A format
**Priority**: High (labeled high-priority, aeo, content)

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + lint + visual verification for content changes)

### Current State Assessment
- **Sections affected**: Why Us, Services, Pricing, Approach, Confidential AI, Contact
- **CSS files involved**: None (content-only changes)
- **Current behavior**: Standard marketing copy with descriptive headings

### Current Headings Inventory (from App.jsx)
| Line | Current Heading | Heading Type |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 350 | "Why work with AI Ready PDX?" | H2 (already Q format) |
| 357 | "Decades of tech leadership" | H3 - needs transform |
| 366 | "We know tech and business" | H3 - needs transform |
| 375 | "We're already doing this" | H3 - needs transform |
| 384 | "People and culture come first" | H3 - needs transform |
| 397 | "How We Help Your Industry" | H2 - needs transform |
| 548 | "Need to Keep Your AI Off the Public Internet?" | H2 (already Q format) |
| 571 | "Pricing" | H2 - needs transform |
| 631 | "Our Approach" | H2 - needs transform |
| 682 | "Frequently Asked Questions" | H2 (already Q format section) |
| 729 | "Let's talk about AI in your business" | H2 - could stay or transform |

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Moderate
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Risk**: Low - content changes only, no structural or CSS changes needed

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: The FAQ section already uses Q&A format effectively (lines 682-721)
**Reference**: FAQ items have question headings with expandable answers containing front-loaded information

---

## Executive Summary

This implementation transforms the AI Ready PDX website content to optimize for AI Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). The changes involve:
1. Converting section headings from descriptive statements to question-based format
2. Adding TL;DR summaries to major sections
3. Restructuring paragraph content to front-load key information in 40-60 word summaries

The existing FAQ section demonstrates the target pattern. All changes are content-only modifications to `src/App.jsx`.

| Planning | 10m |
| **Total** | **20m** |

---

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **Line number drift** - The source file is ~872 lines; multiple edits in sequence may shift line numbers. Build agent should re-read sections after each edit to verify correct line positions.
2. **Escaped apostrophes** - React uses `&apos;` for apostrophes in JSX text content. Build agent must maintain this pattern in new content.

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 4/5
**Missing Information**:
- No specific guidance on whether to add structured data (schema.org FAQ markup)
- No preference on TL;DR placement (before or after descriptive paragraph)

**Suggested Input Improvements**:
- Include examples of preferred TL;DR formatting
- Specify if FAQ schema markup should be added for SEO

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For content restructuring issues, create a complete "before/after" mapping table of all affected headings upfront
2. Consider grouping all headings in a single phase if they follow the same pattern

**For Build Agent**:
1. Read each section immediately before editing to verify exact line numbers
2. Use the existing FAQ section (lines 682-721) as reference for Q&A tone
3. Maintain brand voice: "Calm, competent, grounded - not hype-driven"

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. AEO optimization is a repeatable pattern - could become a reusable template
2. Consider adding schema.org FAQ structured data in a follow-up issue for enhanced AEO
