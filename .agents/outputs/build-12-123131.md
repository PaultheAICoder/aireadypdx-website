## Test Strategy Recommendation
**Category**: CONTENT
**Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + lint + visual verification)

**Recommended Test Checks**:
1. Verify all `<strong>` tags render with proper bold styling
2. Check mobile responsiveness - ensure long statistics don't break layouts
3. Verify existing links (Vital Enterprises, VTM, Novus Labs) still work
4. Check FAQ accordion still functions correctly with new content
5. Verify hero pillars display correctly on mobile

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. No blockers encountered - all edits applied cleanly
2. Plan provided exact line numbers which made edits efficient
3. No lint or build errors during any phase

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Very clear with exact before/after code blocks
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All 8 phases covered comprehensively
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 4/5 - Line numbers were close but shifted slightly after each edit
**Missing Information in Plan**: None significant - plan was thorough

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **JSX Escaping**: File already used proper `&apos;` escaping throughout, no new issues created
2. **Strong Tags**: Used `<strong>` consistently as specified, matching existing patterns in the codebase
3. **Line Length**: Some paragraphs are now longer with added statistics; CSS handles wrapping appropriately
4. **Content Density**: Multiple bold elements per paragraph works visually but should be reviewed for overwhelming effect on mobile

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Consider adding a "bold element count" limit per paragraph to prevent visual overload
2. Could include mobile-specific testing instructions for content-heavy changes

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Edit operations were smooth; continuing to provide exact before/after blocks is very helpful
2. Intermediate validation after each phase helps catch issues early

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Pay attention to mobile rendering of sections with multiple bold statistics
2. Check that the services table section (unchanged) still displays correctly alongside the new intro text
3. Verify FAQ accordion height adjustments work correctly with longer answer content

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. The plan's statistics summary table was excellent for tracking - recommend keeping this format
2. Consider adding a content review step for brand consistency when adding claims/statistics
