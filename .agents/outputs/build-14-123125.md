## Test Strategy Recommendation
**Category**: CONTENT
**Strategy**: STANDARD (Build + visual verification)

**Recommended Tests**:
1. Verify all renamed images load correctly on the live site
2. Verify alt text appears when hovering over images or inspecting elements
3. Check responsive behavior of new section images on mobile/tablet views
4. Verify Confidential AI section layout with new image replacing SVG icon
5. Run accessibility audit (e.g., Chrome DevTools Lighthouse) to confirm alt text improves accessibility score

## Performance Metrics
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Plan Review | 2m |
| Phase 1 (Hero rename) | 1m |
| Phase 2 (Section images) | 3m |
| Phase 3 (Verification) | 1m |
| Documentation | 2m |
| **Total** | **9m** |

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Build
1. **ESLint config missing** - As noted in the plan, `npm run lint` fails due to missing `eslint.config.js`. This doesn't block the build but means we couldn't validate JSX style. Recommend creating an ESLint config for future work.
2. **No issues encountered** - All file renames and code edits completed successfully on first attempt.

### Plan Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Instructions**: 5/5 - Excellent detail with exact file paths, line numbers, and code snippets
**Completeness of Subtasks**: 5/5 - All necessary steps were included
**Accuracy of Patterns/References**: 5/5 - Line numbers and code patterns matched exactly
**Missing Information in Plan**: None - Plan was comprehensive

### Code & Architecture Observations
1. **Section images CSS** - Added `.section-image`, `.about-image`, `.contact-image`, and `.confidential-ai-img` classes. These follow the existing naming conventions in the codebase.
2. **Confidential AI section change** - Replaced SVG icon with actual image. This changes the visual appearance but uses a more relevant image asset.
3. **Image sizing** - Used `max-width` constraints (200px, 500px, 600px) to maintain responsive behavior consistent with existing styles.

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. The plan correctly identified the ESLint config issue upfront - this was helpful
2. Providing exact line numbers for edits made execution very smooth
3. Suggesting alternative implementations (minimal vs full) was helpful for decision-making

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. No issues - execution was straightforward with the detailed plan
2. Starting dev server for visual verification is essential for image-related changes

**For Test-and-Cleanup Agent**:
1. Verify the Confidential AI section looks correct with the new image replacing the SVG
2. Check that image aspect ratios work well on different screen sizes
3. Run Lighthouse accessibility audit to confirm alt text improves score
4. Verify images don't cause layout shifts during page load

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Consider adding ESLint config setup to the project to enable lint validation
2. Image accessibility issues should include a Lighthouse baseline score for comparison
