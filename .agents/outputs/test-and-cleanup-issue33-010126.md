## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - validation completed without issues.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All required sections implemented
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Follows established pattern, proper escaping, clean structure
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Build report included thorough section breakdown and test recommendations

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Continue providing complete inline code in plans - Build agent confirmed this is highly effective
2. Include specific lint escape patterns (like `&apos;`) in code samples

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Service page pattern is now mature - can be completed efficiently for Issue #34
2. Total time of ~15m for new service pages is a good benchmark

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. When Build agent reports clean builds, focus validation on visual verification
2. Acceptance criteria checklist from issues provides clear validation targets

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Three service pages now use identical patterns - consider documenting in CLAUDE.md
2. Workflow is efficient: Scout (21m) + Build (15m) + Test (8m) = ~44m total per service page

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-33-employee-training-page.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173/services/employee-training
3. Issue #34 (Confidential AI) is ready to execute using same pattern
4. Issue #36 (SEO files) should update sitemap.xml and llms.txt after all service pages complete
