**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Thorough build report with insights

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Include HTML entities (&apos;) in JSX code examples to prevent lint issues
2. For third-party embeds, note that URLs may need browser verification

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Test iframes in actual browser during development phase
2. Consider adding aria-label to iframes for accessibility

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. This validation went smoothly - maintain same verification checklist
2. Could add automated schema validation with jsonld-lint

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Add schema validation step to local SEO features checklist
2. Consider Puppeteer/Playwright for visual regression testing
