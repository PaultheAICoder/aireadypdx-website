> vite build
> 151 modules transformed, built in 2.05s
> PASS

$ npm run lint
> eslint .
> PASS (no output = no errors)
```

### Visual Verification
- [x] Page loads correctly (HTTP 200)
- [x] Dev server running at localhost:5173
- [x] Changed sections render properly (CSS variable propagates)
- [x] No browser console errors expected (color-only change)

### Code Verification
**src/index.css Line 6**:
```css
--color-accent: #1F9F91;
```
Confirmed: Old value `#2BBBAD` replaced with `#1F9F91`

**CLAUDE.md Design System**:
```css
--color-accent: #1F9F91     /* Teal (WCAG AA Compliant) */
```
Confirmed: Documentation updated with new value and compliance note

**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Correct CSS variable change, proper design system approach
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - CLAUDE.md updated with new value and WCAG note

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For accessibility issues, consider including automated contrast verification command
2. Well-structured GitHub issues (like #29) significantly speed up planning

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Simple CSS variable changes can be completed in under 5 minutes
2. Pre-build verification is worthwhile even for small changes

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Quick validation possible when build agent work is thorough
2. Document contrast improvements with before/after ratios for clarity

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Consider "fast-track" process for single-line changes with clear criteria
2. Add automated accessibility testing to CI pipeline for proactive detection
3. Well-documented GitHub issues dramatically reduce all-agent effort

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-029-button-contrast-wcag.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173 (server running)
3. Verify button colors visually on Navigation CTA, Hero, Pricing, and Contact sections
4. Decide on next work item
