**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #8
**Estimated Build Time**: 1-2 hours
**Complexity**: Moderate

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Feature (SEO/Schema Enhancement)
**Source**: GitHub Issue #8
**Priority**: High (labeled high-priority)
**Labels**: high-priority, seo, schema

### Task Classification
**Category**: FEATURE
**Test Strategy**: STANDARD - Build + lint + schema validation

### Current State Assessment
- **File affected**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html`
- **Existing schema**: ProfessionalService (lines 35-70) and FAQPage (lines 73-120)
- **Current schema location**: Inside `<head>` tag, two separate `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks
- **Build status**: Passing (verified)
- **Lint status**: Clean (verified)

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Moderate
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low - Adding new JSON-LD blocks, non-breaking change

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Existing JSON-LD schema structure in `index.html` lines 34-120
**Reference**:
- ProfessionalService schema pattern (lines 35-70)
- FAQPage schema pattern (lines 73-120)
- Both use `<script type="application/ld+json">` format

---

## Executive Summary

This plan adds Course and Service structured data schemas to the website to enable rich search results and AI citation for training and service offerings. Five new schemas will be added: three Course schemas (with Offer pricing) for training products and two Service schemas for consulting services. All schemas will be placed in index.html following the existing JSON-LD pattern.

**Instructions**:
1. Add a new `<script type="application/ld+json">` block after line 120
2. Create Course schema with the following structure:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "name": "AI Readiness Session",
  "description": "A 60-90 minute consultation to review how your organization runs today, identify 3-5 specific AI opportunities with rough ROI estimates, and receive a written AI Opportunities Snapshot.",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "AI Ready PDX",
    "url": "https://aireadypdx.com"
  },
  "educationalLevel": "Beginner",
  "timeRequired": "PT90M",
  "inLanguage": "en",
  "offers": {

    "priceValidUntil": "2025-12-31",
    "description": "90% off for first 100 clients (regular price $500)"
  }
}
```

**Validation**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint

## Phase 3: Validation

### Subtask 3.1: Full Build and Lint Verification

- [ ] No errors reported by validators

---

## Summary of Deliverables

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/index.html` (add 5 new JSON-LD schema blocks)

**New Schemas Added**:
| Schema Type | Name | Price |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Course + Offer | AI Readiness Session | $50 |
| Course + Offer | AI Training & Quick Wins | $1,500/quarter |
| Course + Offer | AI Deep Dive | $2,500 |
| Service | Workflow Automation | Custom |
| Service | Confidential AI | Custom |

---

## Handoff to Build Agent

1. Execute subtasks in exact order (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1)
2. Each new schema block should be added AFTER line 120 (after the FAQPage schema closing tag)
3. Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces) matching existing schemas
4. Test completion criteria before moving to next subtask
5. Run `npm run build` after each subtask to catch JSON syntax errors early
6. Final validation with `npm run build && npm run lint`

**Build Agent Notes**:
- All schemas go in `index.html`, not in React components
- Each schema is a separate `<script type="application/ld+json">` block
- Provider organization details should be consistent across all schemas
- The areaServed pattern from the existing ProfessionalService schema (lines 50-62) should be reused for Service schemas

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **Schema.org documentation exploration** - Needed to research Course and Service schema properties to ensure compliance with schema.org standards. Resolved by using WebSearch and WebFetch tools to get official examples.
2. **Offer vs direct pricing** - Clarified that Course schema should use nested Offer type for pricing information, not a direct price property.

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 5/5
**Missing Information**: None - the issue was well-structured with specific services, prices, and schema types
**Suggested Input Improvements**: None needed - this was an exemplary issue with clear requirements

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. When dealing with schema.org tasks, always fetch the official schema.org page for the type to get accurate property definitions
2. Check existing schema patterns in the codebase first to ensure consistency

**For Build Agent**:
1. Add each schema block one at a time and run build to catch JSON syntax errors early
2. Use a JSON validator to check schema syntax before running build
3. Consider combining all schemas into a single `@graph` structure in future for cleaner code (but not required for this implementation)

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Schema tasks are well-suited for this workflow - clear input, clear output, validation is straightforward
2. Consider adding schema validation (Rich Results Test) as a standard post-deployment check
