**Task**: GitHub Issue #7 - Add FAQPage JSON-LD Schema
**Workflow Status**: COMPLETE

## Validation Summary

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Build Errors | 0 | 0 |
| Lint Warnings | 0 | 0 |
| Console Errors | 0 | 0 |
| JSON-LD Syntax Errors | 0 | 0 |

### Blocker Resolutions
None required - all validation checks passed on first run.

### Automated Validation
```bash
$ npm run build
vite v5.4.21 building for production...
dist/index.html                   6.41 kB
dist/assets/index-Dh7Lhwj8.css   35.00 kB
dist/assets/index-BHLaHy2d.js   423.17 kB
built in 2.06s

$ npm run lint
(no output - zero errors, zero warnings)

$ node -e "JSON.parse(...)" # JSON-LD validation
Schema 1: ProfessionalService - VALID JSON
Schema 2: FAQPage - VALID JSON
  FAQ items: 5
```

### Visual Verification
- [x] Page loads correctly (HTTP 200)
- [x] Title renders: "AI Ready PDX | AI Consulting for Portland Businesses"
- [x] No visual changes expected (schema is invisible)

### Schema Content Verification
- [x] All 5 FAQ items present in schema
- [x] No promotional content ("$50", "Limited Time") in schema
- [x] No HTML tags in answer text fields
- [x] Schema appears in dist/index.html after build

## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished

- Issue #18: Review/Testimonial structured data
- Issue #22: Breadcrumb navigation with schema

**Post-Deployment Validation** (documented for manual execution):
1. Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Schema.org Validator: https://validator.schema.org/

### Git Commit
**Message**: feat(issue #7): Add FAQPage JSON-LD schema for rich snippets
**Files Changed**: 3 (index.html, agent outputs, completion report)
**Push Status**: Pending

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - all checks passed on first run.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All requirements met
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Clean JSON-LD, proper structure
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Clear notes on validation and post-deployment steps

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. For schema additions, continue providing exact JSON-LD content - this eliminated interpretation errors
2. The plan correctly identified promotional content to strip - good attention to detail

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. JSON syntax validation via Node.js was a valuable addition beyond standard checks
2. Always verify built output contains schema (not just source)

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Schema validation tooling worked well - reuse for future schema work
2. Consider adding more automated schema validation steps

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This was an exemplary workflow - well-documented issue led to clean plan led to correct implementation
2. Consider adding JSON-LD validation to CI pipeline for future schema changes
3. Schema additions are low-risk changes - STANDARD test strategy is appropriate

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2025-12-31-issue-007-faqpage-schema.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173 (dev server)
3. After deployment, validate with Google Rich Results Test and Schema.org Validator
4. Decide on next work item (related: Issues #8, #18, #22 for additional schema work)
