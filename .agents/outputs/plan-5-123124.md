# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2024-12-31 22:30 PST
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #5
**Estimated Build Time**: 1 hour
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Content (New files for AI crawler optimization)
**Source**: GitHub Issue #5
**Priority**: Critical (per issue labels)

### Task Classification
**Category**: CONTENT
**Test Strategy**: QUICK (Build + lint only - these are static markdown files)

### Current State Assessment
- **Files affected**: New files in `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/`
- **Existing infrastructure**:
  - `robots.txt` exists with AI crawler rules (GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, anthropic-ai, Claude-Web, etc.)
  - `sitemap.xml` exists with single URL entry
  - No llms.txt or llms-full.txt files exist currently
- **Current behavior**: AI crawlers have no llms.txt to reference for site structure

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: <1 hour
**Risk**: Low - adding new static files with no code changes

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: Follow llms.txt specification format (Markdown with H1, blockquote, H2 sections)
**Reference**: Content extracted from:
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/src/App.jsx` (line 275-840) - all site sections
- `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/custom-website-build.md` - brand guidelines and full content

---

## Executive Summary

Create two new markdown files (`llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`) in the public directory following the llms.txt specification. The standard file provides a concise overview for AI systems with limited context, while the full version includes comprehensive content from all site sections. Both files will help AI crawlers understand the site structure, services, pricing, and contact information.

---

## Phase 1: Create Standard llms.txt File

### Subtask 1.1: Create /public/llms.txt
**File**: `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/public/llms.txt`
**Pattern**: Follow llms.txt specification (H1 heading, blockquote summary, descriptive content, H2 sections)
**Instructions**:

Create a new file with the following content structure:

### What does an AI Readiness Session cover?
In our 60-90 minute session (just $50 for the first 100 clients), we review how your organization runs today, identify 3-5 specific AI opportunities with rough ROI estimates, recommend whether on-premise, cloud, or simple SaaS tools make sense for you, and provide a written AI Opportunities Snapshot you can share with your team.

### Is AI safe for sensitive data like legal or medical records?
It can be, with the right setup. We offer both on-premise solutions where data never leaves your network, and locked-down cloud environments with private networking. We also train your team on what's safe to use AI for and what should stay in your core systems.

## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Investigation
1. **llms.txt specification clarity** - Had to fetch the official specification to understand the exact format (H1, blockquote, H2 sections). The issue description mentioned it was "formatted in Markdown" but did not specify the exact structure. Resolution: WebFetch to llmstxt.org provided the specification.

2. **Determining content scope** - Needed to decide what content goes in standard vs full versions. Resolution: Standard version contains concise overview with section links; full version contains all detailed text from the website.

### Input Quality Assessment
**Clarity of Original Request**: 4/5
**Missing Information**:
- No example of desired content style
- No specification of whether robots.txt should reference llms.txt
**Suggested Input Improvements**:
- Include link to llms.txt specification in issue
- Specify if any content should be excluded (e.g., promotional offers with expiration dates)

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. When dealing with new standards/specifications, always fetch the official documentation first
2. For AEO/GEO tasks, consider checking if there are other related files that should be updated (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)

**For Build Agent**:
1. The llms.txt content contains current pricing ($50 promo) - this may need future updates when promotions change
2. Phone number and address are hardcoded - verify these are correct before committing

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Consider adding a "content freshness" flag to plans involving marketing/promotional content that may become stale
2. AEO/GEO tasks should always trigger a review of robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and any meta tag implications
