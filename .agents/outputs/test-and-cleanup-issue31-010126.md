**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Clean React patterns, proper CSS variable usage
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Build output well documented

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Include SEO checklist template (title, meta, keywords) for service pages
2. Document shared CSS opportunity for batch service page creation

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Consider creating ServicePage base CSS for common styles
2. Could establish AIConsulting as formal template for Issues #32-34

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Add visual screenshot capture to completion reports
2. Consider automated responsive testing at standard breakpoints

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. This issue establishes service page patterns - document for reuse
2. Consider batch processing of remaining service pages using this template
3. Shared CSS extraction could reduce total CSS size by ~30% for service pages

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-031-ai-consulting-page.md
2. Test page at http://localhost:5173/services/ai-consulting
3. Consider starting Issue #32 (Workflow Automation) using this page as template
4. Review if shared ServicePage.css should be created before remaining issues
