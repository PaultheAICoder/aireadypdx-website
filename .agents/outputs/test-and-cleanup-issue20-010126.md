## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - clean build on first run.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All planned work completed
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Follows existing patterns, uses design system
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Build agent report was comprehensive

### Process Improvement Suggestions

**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Clearly tag items that require external dependencies/permissions as DEFERRED upfront
2. Providing alternative approaches (image vs text) was very helpful

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Text-based approach for partner displays is simpler and avoids licensing concerns
2. Always verify CSS variable names exist before using them

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Simple features can be validated quickly - no need for extended testing cycles
2. Check for deferred items in original issue to ensure proper tracking

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. User guidance (text-based approach preference) significantly streamlines decision-making
2. Simple additive features complete much faster than estimated (10m vs 2-3hr estimate)

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at `/home/pbrown/aireadypdx/completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-020-trust-signals.md`
2. Test at http://localhost:5173
3. Issue #37 created for deferred work (client logos, trust badges)
4. Decide on next work item
