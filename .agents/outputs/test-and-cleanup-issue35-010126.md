## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - Build agent work was complete and correct.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All acceptance criteria met
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Follows established patterns, proper use of hooks
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Clear comments, good code structure

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Include exact copy for new content sections to reduce need for inference
2. Specify interactive vs static behavior when migrating components

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Consider extracting FAQ to shared component when implementing similar features
2. Continue following established page patterns (AIConsulting.jsx model)

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Check navigation accessibility for new pages (is there a way to reach them?)
2. Verify schema markup considerations for new page content

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Plan-to-build handoff was excellent - no issues during validation
2. Having exact line number references in plan improves Build agent accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-35-about-page.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173/about
3. Consider adding About link to footer/navigation in future issue
4. Next workflow: Issue #36 (Update SEO files with new page URLs)
