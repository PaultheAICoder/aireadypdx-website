### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:

2. For SEO tasks, always include current best practices research

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Continue using complete file replacement for static files
2. Skip dev server for static file updates

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Use automated content verification (grep/diff) for static file validation
2. QUICK strategy is appropriate for CHORE/static file tasks

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Consider "TRIVIAL" test strategy for pure static file updates
2. Add "pre-investigation" step to check for related completed issues

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-01-issue-021-robots-txt-enhancement.md
2. Issue #21 closed with workflow complete comment
3. Decide on next work item
