**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Detailed build report with statistics table

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Include source documentation requirements when adding statistics
2. Consider mobile layout impact when adding multiple bold elements

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Continue providing intermediate validation after each phase
2. Statistics summary table format is excellent - keep using it

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. Quick validation flow works well for content-only changes
2. Could add automated mobile viewport check

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. Create shared statistics library for consistent data across site
2. Add brand voice review step for content with claims/statistics

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2025-12-31-issue-012-aeo-statistics-quotations.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173
3. Decide on next work item
