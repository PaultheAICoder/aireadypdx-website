## Insights & Process Improvements (REQUIRED)

### Issues Encountered During Validation
None - Build agent delivered clean implementation.

### Build Output Quality Assessment
**Completeness of Implementation**: 5/5 - All 10 subtasks completed, 100% coverage
**Code Quality**: 5/5 - Clean build, zero lint warnings, proper escaping maintained
**Documentation Quality**: 5/5 - Comprehensive execution log with before/after details

### Process Improvement Suggestions
**For Future Scout-and-Plan Runs**:
1. Include TL;DR formatting examples in plan when adding TL;DR summaries
2. The before/after content blocks were highly effective - continue this pattern

**For Future Build Runs**:
1. Running build/lint after each phase (not each subtask) was efficient for content changes
2. Brand voice verification ("calm, competent, grounded") should be explicit checkpoint

**For Future Test-and-Cleanup Runs**:
1. For CONTENT tasks, grep-based content verification is faster than full visual review
2. Could add automated pattern checks for expected content transformations

**For Overall Workflow**:
1. AEO content restructuring is repeatable - create template for future AEO issues
2. Task classification (CONTENT/STYLING/FEATURE) is valuable - drove efficient validation

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2025-12-31-issue-011-aeo-qa-restructure.md
2. Test at http://localhost:5173
3. Issue #11 has been closed via GitHub
4. Decide on next work item
