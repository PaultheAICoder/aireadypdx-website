### Who is AI Ready PDX?
AI Ready PDX is part of Vital Enterprises, with 30+ years leading global technology consortiums and 17 years building complex products for leading brands. We help Portland-area businesses and nonprofits adopt AI practically - projects that ship in weeks, clear explanations of what AI can do, and a pace that respects your culture.

### What kinds of businesses do you work with?
We work primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and nonprofits in the Portland metro and Pacific Northwest. Our clients include home service companies, coffee roasters, professional practices like dental and legal offices, small manufacturers, and community organizations.

### Do you offer on-premise AI solutions?
Yes. For organizations with strict data privacy or compliance requirements, we can deploy local AI appliances on your network. Your data never leaves your building, and you get the same capabilities as cloud AI without the privacy concerns.

### What does an AI Readiness Session cover?
In our 60-90 minute session (just $50 for the first 100 clients), we review how your organization runs today, identify 3-5 specific AI opportunities with rough ROI estimates, recommend whether on-premise, cloud, or simple SaaS tools make sense for you, and provide a written AI Opportunities Snapshot you can share with your team.

### Is AI safe for sensitive data like legal or medical records?
It can be, with the right setup. We offer both on-premise solutions where data never leaves your network, and locked-down cloud environments with private networking. We also train your team on what's safe to use AI for and what should stay in your core systems.
